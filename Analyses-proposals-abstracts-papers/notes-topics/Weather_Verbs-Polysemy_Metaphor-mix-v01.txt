Metonymy and Metaphor in Yucanani Mixtec Vocabulary of Weather & Other ‘Natural Phenomena’


As we find when examining the various patterns of grammaticalization of the various senses of Yucanani (as well as other) Mixtec body-part terms, which are among the foremost “Embodied experiential concepts”, , we find the same principles at work in examing the means of lexical derivation which occur in lexical items related to ‘Natural Phenomena’ such as those terms related to WEATHER, TEMPERATURE, and -(NATURAL) ELEMENTS- (such as FIRE, ICE etc..). Of course depending on a populations unique environmental climates and other geographical factors relating to what each linguistic sub-population has been exposed to throughout their existence, these ‘Natural Phenomena’ are slighly less immediate in their other “conceptual primatives” which have resulted from the semantic itineration of certain conceptual primitives to include new meanings. Below we see some examples of such instances; a vulgar, yet particularly salient example of this is that of the term for “fart” and “wind” [ ndà. ʧí ];


I hypothesize that the derivational directionality of this figurative conceptual mapping:
WIND > ‘fart’


Conceptual Blend:
(NATURAL PHENOMENA)-WEATHER-WIND > BODILY FUNCTION-
