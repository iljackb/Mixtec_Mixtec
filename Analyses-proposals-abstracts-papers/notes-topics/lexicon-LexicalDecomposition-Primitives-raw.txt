(I) Primitive Decomposition: (cite)

	A number of (mix) lexical units are easily parsed into smaller phonotactic strings which in many cases contemporaneously remain productive grammatical and/or lexical items in the language. 
	
	Many of the lexical (semantically rich) items represent examples of conceptual primitives or "primes" which in line with the predictions and findings of cognitive semantics, have evidently served as a major source for the expansion of the (mix) lexicon. 

	Examples of such primitives correspond to concepts such as: 

		body-parts
		 primary senses
		 basic human categories (man, woman, etc.)
		 natural entities:
			 weather
			 staple food items….
	
	Also corresponding to the theories of cognitive semantics (cite) is the evidence that the directionality of the lexical expansion is from the most primitive basic domain of SPACE to other less primitive ones.

Semantic Derivational Model of Analysis:
 we may infer possible derivational paths and additional sources of evidence than a purely phonological based approach:
(i.e.since we know that ….?)

Cognitive-Comparative Approaches
we can also look to the literature that exists in related varieties of mixtec for evidence concerning the meaning of a given minimal string in question
 (i.e. as we already have seen in: ka,ku,ini…etc)

Phonological strings associated with unknown/unobserved lexical/phonological string sequences…


(II.II) Directionality of Data Collection in (mix) for Near Term Future

	Over the process of the project, especially once the corpus, tagging and ontological structure is all well in place, the identification and possible parsing of these items may be at least somewhat automated using some basic NLP techniques.

(Identify: Primitives**>  Complex Primitives*** > GET: (mix) items/constructions for these (where they exist))

Conceptual Primitives and cross linguistic ontology:

	The more basic/concrete the concept is, the more easily and likely it will work/ fit in to a cross linguistic ontology. Examples of such are commonly agreed to include at least something akin to the following;
	
Living Being
	Animal
	Human
		Male
		Female

		Adult
 			Elder
		Child

Biological Necessities
	Food
	Water

Elements
	Water
	Sky
		Cloud
		Sun
	Weather 
		Rain
		
Temperature
	Hot
	Warm
	Cool
	Cold

Color

	However for the instances in which there is not any, or there is a schematically weaker correspondence between the conceptualization of a concept that is strong to one language group and not another, i.e. if one language/community conceptually (/and lexically) specifies/distinguishes something that another doesn't in order to avoid culturally biased assumptions leading to inaccuracies in the system, we need to allow for spectral differences in the cross linguistic embodied schematic knowleage of a concept/ontological class.

	To do this, for each super linguistic ontological concept, that individual should have a language specific weight measure

	e.g. 
	US-Eng speakers commonly only specify the concept CACTUS; whereas Mix speakers (as well as Mexican spanish speakers) both conceptually and lexically distinguish multiple individuals out of what the former refers to as CACTUS.
