(i)
	By transcribing phonetically first, the resulting dataset contains significant information regarding synchronic variation in the language's (or perhaps a speaker's) phonological system, with the former is of course relevant to the historical, and comparative aspects of the language. Subsequently, I have easily found many such synchronic variations, some of which are conditioned, others do not seem to be. 

Conditioned:
	Phonetically
		Where the verb to which the prefix is being attached contains nasals or nasalized vowels:
		kù-  > kũ̀-  > (ũ̀- ~ ŋ̀-)
		POT-

(POT=potential (derived from the synchronically co-existing copula 'kùù'))

	Phonologically:
		Where the first tone bearing portion of the verb is Rising/High:
			nì- > (tone transposition)
		 ndí.vì
		 break-3s
			as in: 
				ndì.vì
				CMP\break
(CMP=completive prefix)

Unconditioned:

ví.kò.nũ̀ṹ  ~ bí.kò.nũ̀ṹ ~ βí.kò.nũ̀ṹ
'fog'

ʃnũ̀ũ̀.βí.kò ~ (ʃ/s)(n/ɲ)ũ̀ũ̀.(v/β/b)í.k(ò/ù)
'(San Juan de) Mixtepec (city)

(ii) Lexical Decomposition

	Another area that I have been setting up my descriptive transcription (phono/etics/logy) system to optimize specifically due to the particular nature of the language is that of lexical decomposition, which is incredible useful in every possible aspect of the general documentation project. For example, the sentence shown above 'it was cloudy yesterday' carries a whole lot more information than just what is conveyed in the grammatical or translation gloss:

	nì-kù-víkò.nũ̀ṹ  tá.kù.nì
	CMP-be -foggy yesterday
	'it was foggy yesterday'	

nì-kù.ví.kò.nũ̀ṹ
	nì- = CMP-
	kù=COP*
	ví.kò='cloud'
		nũ̀ũ̀='face'
			ví.kò.nũ̀ṹ (lit.'cloud'+'face') ='fog'

	*kù=COP-' + noun(weather) => verbalization of(noun…)

tá.kù.nì
	('time/when'+'be'+'past')='yesterday'
	tá='time/when'
	kù=COP'be'
	nì=CMP(past)
