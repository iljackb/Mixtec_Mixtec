This portion of the lexicography project deals with the only known body of literature in Mixtepec-Mixtec language which is comprised of series of 34* orthographic children's texts published by SIL Mexico (Summer Institute of Linguistics). The target audience of these documents is primarily young MIX speakers and are designed for use as classroom handouts and/or lessons for primary/elementary school-level. The topical content of these publications contain both culturally specific, and non-culturally specific subject matter supplemented by illustrations. Topics covered in these documents include: vocabulary, mathematics, telling time, geography, seasons, weather, local agricultural practices, fables, local Mixtec legends amongst others. These publications make up the second most important collection in this project and they remain the only source of reference for examples of how the working orthography of the Mixtec language is applied to the Mixtepec variety.

The encoding of this portion of the MIX Language resources can be divided into the following components:

i) TEI-XML markup of documents that supports reuse and extension within this project and/or for other interested parties;

ii) Annotation and glossing of lexical information and structures in documents;
   Tasks include;
	- glossing of orthographical lexical items;
	- assignment of lexical properties to sentences, phrases and lexical items (morpho-/syntactic; pragmatic; semantic etc.);
	- linking of various tokens of the same lexical item;
	- linking corresponding bilingual items (Spanish-Mixtec) within each document;
	- entry of analyzed, glossed and categorized lexical information into TEI-Dictionary;
	- link orthographical forms of lexical items with phonetic transcriptions of spoken forms;

 iii) Classification of Document Types and Ontology Linking;
	- replace current SIL document classification model with established and expansible document system which can be used to classify any new document or literature produced in the language in the future;

	- as per the goal of the overall project, the use of language-specific glosses (including 'Interlingua') will be replaced by grounding the semantic profile of each lexical item by referencing ontological entities (from existing ontologies such as DBpedia, SKOS, etc.);

(OTHER VERSION OF) PROJECT GOALS

Basic Tasks:

I. Integrate all MIX language data from SIL-Mexico into Corpus:
(Dataset: 36 (pdf) documents in MIX orthography published by SIL Mexico)

		- Encode SIL-Mexico data into XML
			> Archive encoded dataset in OLAC (w/permission)

		- Annotate, gloss language data;

		- Integrate into corpus;


Goals:
- Integrate the pre-existing MIX language data from our own spoken language data collection and research with the knowledge of language entailed in these documents;

-Integrate the pre-existing orthographical MIX language and vocabulary with the phonetically transcribed data from our corpus;

-Increase size of MIX vocabulary documented in corpus;

- Create a dynamically tagged/ searchable version of the collection of the documents and their contents;

- Topic specific language data may potentially serve as (primitive) resource for cross-linguistic ontological knowledge base analogical comparison;
		>Connect tagged XML data to external ontology/ontologies;


-to further support various potential inquiries into the structures of the MIX language.

Document Classification Definitions:

	'PEDIGOGICAL'
		@has at least one concept; (concept(s) is/are ontologocal in nature; have additional structuring necessary); 
		-can have @ INTERACTIVE (which means there is component for user imput on document (has unique formatting requirements);
		-(are inherantly 'NON-FICTION')

	'FICTION'
		has @type:
			'FANTASY' (antrhopomorphic and/or other scenarios that are not scientifically possible)
			'REALISTIC' (document contains events, scenarios that could happen, but did not)
	'FOLKLORE'
		-are inherantly similar to fiction in that t hey may not be true events, however (at least in this version) they are not classified as subtypes of that class because the stories contained represent highly valued anthropological cultural information;
		-docs whose Spanish description includes the word 'leyenda' are all classified as 'FOLKLORE'
