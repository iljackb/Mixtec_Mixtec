The idea expressed by this second gloss is more literal and thus according to the cognitive semantics principle which states that grammatical extensions expand from concrete > abstract, 'look at Maria's face' shows that the facial subpart of Maria's person has been extended (Metonymy) to refer to the whole.  ----
The example in which ‘face’ semantically refers to the speaker (i.e. 1s) but is not marked is evidence for the default or source sense of the term in the spatial sense as being from the speaker. (This may also be evidence towards concepts related to embodiment and directionality)
-----Next: Connect the former with { relative locations, prepositions, projecting space, general orientation}Additionaly, several authors have pointed out that since humans inherantly associate the 'face' with the everyday person-person interactions, and  attention, this BPT makes a fiiting candidate to expand in expressing concepts that are related to the functional nature of the BPT (Svorou, 1994: 74,87-88).

(face- 'from me')

Jack Bowers:These following examples from MIX demonstrate the futility of attempting to decipher the meaning of ‘face’ through what appears to be their English translation. This feature has been pointed out in previous discussions of Mixtecan BPT (Hollenbach, 1995: 178), (Macaulay, 1996: pp?). These studies adopt, or at least accept the equal validity of the approach articulated in Brugman (1983), and Brugman and Macaulay (1986) which states that the relation in these constructions are expressed by the verb, and the body-part noun's lexical function is to  label a part or projecting space (Hollenbach, 1995: 178).  This issue of conflicting English glosses is a central factor in why Brugman and Macaulay assert that BPT are best interpereted as Noun-Noun sequences (in which the first Noun is the BPT), and not prepositions.

(on comparative pronominal use).... as there is not any obvious locative, spatial or any other physical relation, configurationWhat this example does show however is that as in the examples above, this extension  of 'face' would remain understandable in terms of the exended reference to the individual as in the examples above ('...from me'/'...to me'). Specifically, just as the aformentioned could be connected to the metonMIXic extensions from the face representing a subpart of the body to the whole physical person, this example shows 'face' having kept the profile of the whole person, though it has shed the physical attribute. A nuance to this is that in the construction, neither the grammatical or semantic content explicitly reference any  locative, spatial or any other physical relation, configuration or even action as having taken place. Nonetheless, the entity profiled (the speaker), is after all a human being, and thus at the fundamental basis of our experience is a physical entity, which also by no coincidence has a face, which I propose is indeed the origin of this extension, just as in ('look at Maria/'s face'). The inability of this attributive constructions semantic context, or 'Situational Semantics' to provide any informative imput from which we can understand the connection between 'face' and the sentence is a primary factor in why Johnson (1987) rejects such "Objectivist" based frameworks for analyzing the linguistic structure where seeking to give deeper meaning to either the mental processes in which the situation and utterance is understood (pxxxiii-xxxxv).Johnson states that such accounts of the role of semantics language make no attempt to account for how units of meaning are mapped onto the world, and in ignoring this question, they deny the role of embodiment and their structures in the creation of meaning (xxxxv).

Embodiment and Spatial TermsDue to the face that many the constructions are expressing opposing spatial configurations or trajectories, these next examples demonstrate the futility in trying to understand the use of nũ̀ː in Mixtec without keeping in mind that their source is the embodied schematic concepts, or complex primitive associated with the FACE. Especially deleterious would be to attempt to track the meaning in terms of a single Cartesian directionality and/or according to the English gloss of the construction in which each token is observed (Langacker, 1987, 1989, 2002).
