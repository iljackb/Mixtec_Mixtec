This fact is syntactically marked by the attachment of the topic marker ‘-ɣá’ to the end of the item meaning ‘siblings’:nánì we-tã́ʔã̀-ɣá  nũ̀ṹbe elder 3.pl.inf-sibling-tpc  face/1s‘my siblings are elder than me’If we are approaching this analysis from a perspective that doesn’t recognize the role of complex primitves in polysemy, particularly those associated with FACE, and which places excessive focus on the geometric spatial orientation of that part of the body as the source of extension, this example will likely be difficult to grasp.
