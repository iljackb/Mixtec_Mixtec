      The class of things that happen and have temporal parts or stages.
      Examples include extended events like a football match or a race, actions like pursuing and reading, and biological processes.
      The formal definition is: anything that occurs in time but is not an object.
      Note that a process may have participants 'inside' it which are objects, such as the players in a football match. 
      In a 4D ontology, a process is something whose spatiotemporal extent is thought of as dividing into temporal stages roughly perpendicular to the time-axis. [SUMO 2010]

                    <quote>Indicates a relationship of equivalency between the subject and predicate or complement of a clause. 
                    Verbal copulas have essentially the same morphosyntactic properties as verbs: English 'be', Spanish 'ser', and Russian 'byt’' are illustrations of this class.
                    Nonverbal copular items include the the pro-copula - a demonstrative or personal pronoun which serves as the linker between subject and predicate nominal, and which is obligatory in nominal predication - and particle copulas, which have their origin in a variety of markers of discourse-oriented phenomena such as topicalization, backgrounding, or contrastive focus for subjects or predicates. Zero copula refers to a construction in which the relation between a subject and a nominal predicate is not marked by an overt item. Zero copula is mandatory in some languages, such as Sinhalese, whereas it is conditional or restricted in other languages, such as Russian. [Stassen 2008]</quote>

                 <desc>From GOLD <ref>Tense</ref>
                 Following [Comrie 1985: vii], we take tense to be the grammaticalisation of location in time. 
                 Tense Property is assigned to clauses on the basis of semantics: a tense value is selected for
                 the clause from the range of tense values available in the given language. Tense Property is typically
                 realised on the verb, but it may be found expressed multiply on different elements in the same clause.
                 For example, tense may be found on more than one element of the verbal complex (e.g. in Kayardild [Evans 2003] or 
                 Paamese [Crowley 2002: 68], or on verbs as well as on certain spatial and temporal adverbs and certain prepositions 
                 in the same clause (e.g. in Malagasy [Randriamasimanana 1981: 355-367], [Keenan and Polinsky 1998: 566-567]. 
                 In the given language, the values of the Tense Property are assigned to the designated elements as a consequence of 
                 semantic choice, and all the available options of particular tense values expressing particular tense meanings can be
                 described with a Tense Assignment System for that language. Since no languages have been found for which tense values are

Typically, for an aspect value to be labelled as Imperfective, the aspectual meaning has to minimally express the imperfective viewpoint, although it may additionally express other temporal, aspectual, or modal meanings, or actionality distinctions. Imperfective aspectual meaning can be further subdivided into two types: habitual meaning and continuous meaning. These two aspectual meanings may or may not be grammaticalised as separate aspect values. [Kibort 2008c: 7]-->

                    <desc>(ISOcat Source?) <ref target="#DEONTIC">Deontic modality</ref>: is concerned with the necessity or possibility of acts performed by morally responsible 
                       agents and is thus associated with the social functions of permission and obligation. 
                       Deontic modality focuses on the notions of obligation and permission. It is found in directives 
                       that grant permission (‘you may go now’) or impose obligations (‘eat your vegetables!’), as well as in 
                       statements that report deontic conditions. Deontic modality fails to distinguish subcategories that are
                       expressed inflectionally from lexical or periphrastic expressions of obligation or permission. Deontic modality as
                       traditionally understood excludes certain semantically related notions such as ability and desire that have linguistic
                       expression similar to that of permission and obligation. [Bybee and Fleischman 1995: 4-5]</desc>

                 component / integral object : 
                  there is a clear structural and functional relation between the whole and its parts, e.g. handle/cup, phonology/linguistics.
                 
                member / set or group : 
                  parts do not necessarily have a structural or functional relation with respect to the whole, parts are distinct from each other. In this class fall for example tree/forest, student/class.
                  
                  portion / mass : 
                     There is a complete similarity between the parts and between parts and the whole. Limits between parts are arbitrary and parts do not have any specific function a priori with respect to the whole. We have in this class for example: slice/bread, centimeter/meter. This subrelation is often called a mereology.
                     
                     object / material : 
                        This type of relation describes the materials from which an object is constructed or created, or the constitutive elements of an object, e.g. alcohol/wine, steel/car.
                     
                     subactivity / activity or process : 
                        describes the different subactivities that form an activity in a structured way, for example in a temporally organized way. Into this class fall examples such as : pay/buy, give exams/teach.
                        
                        precise place / area : 
                        parts do not really contribute to the whole in a functional way. This subrelation expresses spatiality, as in : oasis/desert, Alps/Europe.

            <label>Personal Inflections</label><lb/>
            
            <p>As discussed by Hills (1990) regarding the pronominal units in <lang>Ayutla Mixtec</lang>, <lang>Mixtepec-Mixtec</lang> features the rather utilitarian strategy for expressing different syntactic and semantic functions by simply adding a modular personal inflection to various lexical categories, and thus it isn’t possible to distinguish their grammatical function independent of the syntactic and semantic context in which they are applied.  While previous studies in other Mixtec varieties refer to these lexical units as “pronouns”, in this analysis of <abbr>MIX</abbr>, these are referred as “personal inflections”, or “personal inflection markers” to dissociate these units from some of the less dynamic pronominal markers often encountered in many languages.</p><lb/> 
               
               <p>In the aforementioned unmarked MIX constructions, the (A) or (U) argument is characterized by a personal inflection that will alter at least some part of the offset portion of the verbal argument (for this reason, these case will henceforth be represented in this discussion as “-(A)”, “-(U)”). In “unmarked” constructions, this will appear in one of the following ways;</p>
               
             

        <lb/>
            
               <label>Zero Argument (A-Transitive) Constructions</label>
               <p> In every MIX A-transitive construction thus far observed, the core verbal argument is a combination of the Copula ‘ku˥˩’ with another lexical unit. </p>

            <p>The strategies for negation in various Mixtec systems have been examined at length by Macaulay (1990). At least with respect to the ten varieties of Mixtec considered in the aforementioned study, and
               whose negative markers are displayed in the table (below), MIX appears to present a somewhat unique in how it marks negation, making use of several different negation markers, some corresponding to those below, and some unique.idi We will start by discussing the two negative adverbial markers that appear to not have any cognates in (at least the 10) other Mixtec systems. From the observations of the negative constructions we have collected thus far, the manner in which these forms are used in MIX syntax can be said to correspond rather nicely with the English negation adverbs “no” and “not”.</p>

            <desc>(ISOcat definition; from GOLD) NegationOperator is a negative-marking phrase located in scope position of the verb (specifier or adjoined position). Also called a "negation particle", it is normally associated with the main verb of the clause but may also be a clause-level clitic.[Payne 2007:284; Haegeman 1995: 107, 286]</desc>
          
            
            <p> The negative adverb translating as ‘no’ optionally occurs in sentence initial position, in response to a Y-N question, and in such contexts, as in English, it may co-occur with the negation marker which translates as ‘not’ ‘kwɛ ˩˥’, which may occur as the only marker of negation in a response to a ‘Y-N’ question.</p>

<p>The lone attestation of a tone change to mark the negative shown in the table above is discussed by Hills (1990) in that author’s study of <lang><placeName>Ayutla</placeName> Mixtec</lang>.
   In that study, Hills describes the usage of the negative “marker” as a mid-low-mid tone contour which may occur only in the following phrase types: content verb phrases,equative verb phrases, and stative verb phrases (Ibid).
   The limitations of its occurrence in Ayutla Mixtec are as follows:</p>
   <list>
      <head>The negated constituent:</head>
      <item>may only be realized on a single constituent of the sentence;</item>
      <item>must be within the verb phrase;</item>
      <item>must be sentence initial;</item>
   </list>
<p>
   According to Hills, if the word has two syllables, the mid-low portion of the contour are realized on the first syllable, and the final mid portion is realized on the second. Where there are three syllables, the tri-part contour is realized evenly M-L-M (Ibid).Hills presents examples of certain negated lexical items in which in addition to the transposition of the Mid-Low-Mid tone contour, a glottal stop is also realized on the offset vowel (Ibid). 
   Upon further investigation of this phenomena, evidence collected from a second speaker points to this kind of construction being applicable where the negated predicate is in the future tense.</p>
<p>
   When comparing some of the AM examples to the MIX negative adverb translating to ‘no’[a˥˩ ʔa˩˥], it is hard not to entertain the possibility that the mid-low-mid (or ‘falling-rising’)  tonal contour and the glottal stop may be related to that negative adverbial, or a cognate ancestor of both forms. Below is a constituent and operator projection of the negative version of the ditransitive construction displayed in the previous section “...give money to Jack”). In this negative construction the only difference from the aforementioned is in fact the initial portion of the tone contour which in this construction is “Falling-Rising” (actual F0 plot from utterance in red).

               <p>In contrast to the above, it is not possible to use a verb which is usually transitive such as “eat” with any other elements in the construction such as an adverbial. According to our speaker TS, the following unmarked construction is not acceptable due to the semblance that the Undergoer of the verb (inflected for 1st sg+future tense, (ku ga˥ tsi˥˩)) is in fact the temporal adverb “tomorrow”. </p>

               <p>To understand the reason for the fact that the first example is acceptable while this latter is not, we can analyze the aformentioned according to the explanation offered by Van Valin (2005) in which that author examines a grammatically similar case in English. Herein Van Valin asserts that a distinction should be made between the basic lexical meaning of a verb and the meaning of that verb in a given context (Ibid). 
                  To demonstrate this latter point, Van Valin shows the logical structure (LS) of the verb ‘drink’ as an Activity “ do’ (x, [drink’ (x,y)]), is different from that the same verb as an Active Accomplishment “ do’ (x, [drink’ (x,y)]) + INGR consumed‘ (y)” (Ibid). This LS is also true in the case of the MIX construction; to avoid this ambiguity, the adverbial element can be fronted to the onset position of the construction.</p>

The internal structure of MIX obliques consist of a prepositional directional marker (derived from body parts (see Macaulay 1996)) which are the head of the oblique substructure, and can be represented as a PP. Below we show RRG constituent projections for three such MIX Oblique PP’s as observed in at least one of our recorded speech utterances.

               consistent evidence that points to a more or less common default, or minimal constituent
               ordering in related Mixtec forms which feature a (VSO) ordering in transitive
               constructions, and (VS) in intransitive constructions. A few works in which the
               aforementioned subject matter are discussed are; <ref>(Macaulay, 1996); Chalcatongo</ref>,

               specification to put forth is that due to the possibility that in certain construction,
               the applicability of the concepts of “Subject” and “Object” may not be sufficient to characterize certain grammatical patterns, unless other distinctions are specifically pointed out and detailed, we will distinguish
               (A=Actor, U=Undergoer) both of which may appear as the argument traditionally referred to as “S”.
               Where also referring to the “V” in a construction in which either “A” or “U” occur,
               we will specify between no fewer than four verbal predicate categories, 
               which are, “V(intrans)”, ”V(atrans)”, “V(trans)”, “V(ditrans)”. </p><lb/>

            “Williams 2008” explores and discusses the issue of Fronting in the <lang>Tezoatlan Mixtec</lang> variety (TM) two sentence level tree diagrams presented in the study: (left) shows a modeling of TM Narrow Focus structure;
              (right)  shows a model of the second phenomena in which an argument is fronted as “Fronted Topic” which is given as the sentence structure in constructions in which a new topic is introduced to the discourse.

           <p> In MIX Focus Shifting constructions, the information structure also seems to correspond to that of (TM) as described by “Williams (2008)” based on the characterization of sentence topic described by “Lambrecht (1986)”. In MIX, where the primary argument of verb is being introduced to the discourse is fronted, there is no obligation to mark that argument with the respective post-verbal pronoun (referred to here as the MIX “personal marker”).

            Fronted Topics
            In MIX, the strategy for marking the introduction of a new topic to the discourse corresponds to the same phenomenon described by “Williams (2008)” which occurs in parallel pragmatic context as TM . In these constructions, neither Mixtec variety marks the predicate verb with the personal markers.

            Interrogative constructions in MIX are formed in several ways depending on the type of interrogative construction; there are two general categories for these questions which are: “Yes-No” questions, and “WH”-questions. In each case the question particle is placed in the fronted position.
            
            ‘Y-N’ Questions: a-

            Examples (Y-N) questions:
            a ˥˩ - kã̰˥  ʔmũ˩˥    sãː˩˥ sa ˥˩ vi˩˥

            MIX Interrogative Method II. ‘WH’
           <label> The other options for marking a question in MIX is with a sentence initial interrogative “WH” pronoun, or locative “WH” adverb. In these constructions, the “WH” element, as discussed by Van Valin (2005) are always focal elements, examples of such can be found below, in our overview of MIX Focus structure.</label>

            Sentence Focus
            The example below in which the Focus, Operator, and Constituent projections are laid out for the MIX sentence translating to “my car broke down” literally, “broke down, car, (my)”, This construction does presuppose a pre-established  topic in that the person who asked the initial question, suspected that something happened. The fact that the responder's car is not fronted is evidence that there is pragmatic licence within the discourse to maintain the default information structure of V(-U), as we saw in the previous example, but due to the fact that the specific undergoer (the responder’s car) had not yet been pre-established, it becomes necessary therefore to specify that argument within the standard word ordering of (V)intrans-((U)-1s)=POSS).
