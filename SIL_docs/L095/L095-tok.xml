               This portion of the lexicography project deals with the only known body of literature in Mixtepec-Mixtec language which is comprised of series of 34* orthographic children's texts published by SIL Mexico (Summer Institute of Linguistics). The target audience of these documents is primarily young MIX speakers and are designed for use as classroom handouts and/or lessons for primary/elementary school-level. The topical content of these publications contain both culturally specific, and non-culturally specific subject matter supplemented by illustrations. Topics covered in these documents include: vocabulary, mathematics, telling time, geography, seasons, weather, local agricultural practices, fables, local Mixtec legends amongst others. These publications make up the second most important collection in this project and they remain the only source of reference for examples of how the working orthography of the Mixtec language is applied to the Mixtepec variety.
               The encoding of this portion of the MIX Language resources can be divided into the following components:
               <list>
                  <item>i) TEI-XML markup of documents that supports reuse and extension within this project and/or for other interested parties;</item>
                  
                  <item>ii) Annotation and glossing of lexical information and structures in documents; tasks include;
                     
                     <list>
                        <item>glossing of orthographical lexical items;</item>
                        <item>assignment of lexical properties to sentences, phrases and lexical items (morpho-/syntactic; pragmatic; semantic etc.);</item>
                        <item>linking corresponding bilingual items (Spanish-Mixtec) within each document;</item>
                        <item>entry of analyzed, glossed and categorized lexical information into TEI-Dictionary;</item>
                        <item>link orthographical forms of lexical items with phonetic transcriptions of spoken forms;</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
                  
                  <item>iii) Classification of Document Types and Ontology Linking;
                     <list>
                        <item>replace current SIL document classification model<ref target="#tax.sil-mix"/> with established and expansible document system which can be used to classify any new document or literature produced in the language in the future;</item>
                        <item>as per the goal of the overall project, the use of language-specific glosses (including 'Interlingua') will be replaced by grounding the semantic profile of each lexical item by referencing ontological entities (from existing ontologies such as DBpedia, SKOS, etc.);</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Ideas for potential future use of encoded resource in the interest of the Mixtepec-Mixtec language community:
               
                  Potential applications of the contents document for speakers and/or potential learners of the material covered herein and/or the Mixtepec-Mixtec language,
               This, along with the other documents in this corpus of the category "pedigogical: interactive" can fairly easily be converted into interactive software applications 
               in which the correct answers are supplied and the user has to provide the correct content. 
               
                 Of the original language content, the: images and questions supplied in original publications the forms/worksheets could be made into a program that can automatically bring up a question
               from the pedigocical - interactive documents (in any order) and the user can supply the answer by typing the appropriate answer the same way they would write it in.
               
                 However since L095 doesn't have the complete answer supplied for any of the 12 questions, in order to make this application we would have to add new language content to that from the published data
               by including the expected answers. This could be done in a number of ways, including in accordance with the suggestions of the original authors, consultants, and/or according to one or more other native speakers 
               (such as those who have participated in project begun at SJSU in the US).
               
                 In such a scenario, any products produced through the pursuite of these proposed ideas would be make freely available to the community and not be for any finantial gain on the part of those who may work on it; 
                  
                 Expanding upon the original questions/contents could create a much larger, and dynamic version of the application;
               This could include any one or all of the following components:
               
                 i) an expanded variety of images relative configurations between what Langacker (1978) calls the 'trajector' (tr) (eg. the cat), and the 'landmark' (lm) (eg. the neigboring object(s)),
                 
                 ii) we could create and integrate recordings of the question prompt spoken by a native speaker..
                 
                 iii) (contingent upon the expansion of the img inventory), we could also expand upon the vocabulary utilized in excercise by using more than just "vilu" (eng "cat") as the stimulus;
                     This would be a good way to integrate, and re-enforce the use other vocabulary items contained in the set of publications (and/or other sources).
                              
                 Were funding to be secured, such an application could be made for desktop/laptop computers, mobile and/or tablet devices for local schools to make use of;
