            <p>Pre-call discussion on annotation graphs.</p>
        
            <p>Commenced ~12:07 UTC w/ SB, JH, NI, JC, CC.</p>

            <head>deliverables</head>
        
            <p>XPointer tutorial: let's look at what's out there before
          committing to spending time and energy writing one. Although
          the consensus is that a tutorial aimed at the TEI market is
          probably a Good Thing, it is low priority, in part because
          the list of tutorials available out there in the world is
          likely to have changed by the time we finish our other
          work.</p>
        
            <p>XPointer: extension w/ regexp. Yes, we want prose
          describing this as a deliverable. We'd like to take a look
          at what FV's group has done first. He plans to publish a
          paper and open source the implementation of XSLT with
          XPointers extended with regular expressions some time after
          <date when="2002-09-19">the 19th</date>. [FV -- do we have
          that right?]</p>
        
            <p>XLink tutorial: same as XPointer.</p>
        
            <p>XLink: TEI-specific details element names, roles, etc. JH
          suggests that a chunk of prose discussing how to use XLink
          in TEI. We are thinking of a chapter (or section or
          whatever) devoted to using XLink, with references to it
          sprinkled throughout the Guidelines wherever needed.</p>
        
            <p>SB points out we need to identify all the areas of the
          Guidelines that need to be tweaked. I.e., someone needs to
          go through the Guidelines finding each spot that discusses
          linking in an old way that needs to be updated. (Separate
          issue, of course, is someone needs to update it :-)</p>
        
            <p>CC: postponing until next week whether or not discussion of
          time-based stuff is needed.</p>
        
            <p>JH: so, as deliverables, we are going with all 5 DD
	  mentioned in Agenda (e-mail to list <q>Conference call
	    instructions and agenda</q> of <date when="2002-09-13">13 Sep</date>; list of
	  places to update; 2 major sections, 1 on read-only text, 1
	  on read-only other media; JC: a chapter rolling up
	  discussions of the various tasks for XLink (including, but
	  not limited to, indicating ambiguity in a tag and indicating
	  alternative tagging) in one place?</p>
      
         </div>
      
         <div>
        
            <p>For this coming week ('twixt now and next call) JC suggests
	  we discuss whether we should just have specific TEI elements
	  which are XLinks, or whether we will allow any TEI element
	  to be an XLink by using XLink attributes. JH points out we
	  need use use cases.</p>

            <p>Wrapped up at ~12:35 UTC with consensus to try to concentrate
          on XLink issues over next week.</p>
